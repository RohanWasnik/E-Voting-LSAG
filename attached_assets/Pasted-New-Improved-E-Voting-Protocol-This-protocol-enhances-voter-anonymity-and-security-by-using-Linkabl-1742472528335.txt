New Improved E-Voting Protocol
This protocol enhances voter anonymity and security by using Linkable Spontaneous Anonymous Group (LSAG) Signatures. It eliminates collusion risks between the Registration Authority (RA) and Election Authority (EA).

1. Registration Phase
Goal: Ensure voter eligibility verification while maintaining anonymity.

Steps:

The Government (GOV) issues a voter certificate that includes:

σ_v (signed verification token)
Pu_gov (government’s public key)
Pu_voter (voter’s public key)
The voter publishes the certificate on the blockchain using:

scss
Copy
Edit
BB.storePub(CERT_v)
The Election Authority (EA) stores election parameters such as:

scss
Copy
Edit
BB.storePollParams(L, C, r)
L = Election ID
C = List of candidates
r = Random challenge
The voter generates a new key pair (Pu', Pr') and signs the eligibility proof using LSAG:

mathematica
Copy
Edit
σ_v = LSAG.Sign(r, Pu, Pr)
The proof is stored on the blockchain via:

scss
Copy
Edit
BB.verify(σ_v, Pu')
Key Features:

Decentralized voter eligibility check (no reliance on RA/EA).
LSAG ensures voter anonymity while verifying eligibility.
2. Vote Casting Phase
Goal: Ensure anonymous and verifiable vote submission.

Steps:

The voter signs their vote using LSAG:

bash
Copy
Edit
σ_v' = PKS.sign(C_j, Pr')
C_j = Candidate choice
Pr' = Voter’s private key
Compute a cryptographic hash of the vote:

ini
Copy
Edit
h_v = H(σ_v', L)
H = Hash function (e.g., SHA-256)
L = Election ID
Sign the hash to prove integrity:

pgsql
Copy
Edit
σ_v'' = PKS.sign(h_v, Pr')
Store the vote on the blockchain:

python
Copy
Edit
BB.round(σ_v'', h_v, k_v)
k_v = Vote index in the blockchain
Key Features:

Votes are anonymous (no voter identity stored).
Prevents duplicate voting using LSAG linkability.
3. Vote Tallying Phase
Goal: Aggregate votes securely and fairly.

Steps:

The Election Authority verifies each vote:

Ensures valid LSAG signature.
Checks that vote hashes match.
If valid, increment the candidate’s vote count.

Key Features:

Ensures correctness and fairness (only valid votes are counted).
Prevents duplicate voting using LSAG’s linkability.
